    "This study tries to estimate the impact of fertility on the overall wellbeing of parents. Knowledge of this relationship may be important e.g. for demographs because it can help to explain fertility trends. It is also interesting for policy makers who try to desing norms in order maximizes wellbeing of their citizens. To illustrate, if children turn to be significantly positive determinant of wellbeing and at the same time we see decrease in fertility, it might be an impuls to further search why people opt for less children while they desire more. In this case, some e.g. labour policy adjustment supporting part-time employment may help to solve the problem.  \n"

    "There exists a large strand of literature on the impact of fertility on labor market outcomes of mothers. A very interesting and related paper studying the relationship between parental leave provisions and fertility and labor market outcomes for women, is the paper by <a href=\" http://www.jstor.org/stable/40506259\"> Lalive and Zweimüller (2009)</a> They studied 2 natural experiments in Austria, in which the maximum parental leave duration was doubles and then partially reduced. The results were substantial: fertility increased by 4.5 and 3 percentage point in the short and long run respectively. On the other hand, return to work reduced by 11 and 3 percentage points in the short and long run respectively. This implies that less women returned to work. However, there were no differences in employment and labor earnings in the long run. This indicates that even very generous parental leave provisions might not harm a women’s long run labor market prospects. \n",

    "Including the number of children as an independent variable might not be as straightforward as it may seem, due do endogeneity problems: the number of children in a family is not randomly distributed and therefore no causal relationship could be estimated based on this data. To control for this endogeneity, the authors used the occurrence of multiples (twins, triplets etc.) as an instrument for the number of children. We use the similar but simplyfied procedure. Since we have smaller dataset available, we do not estimate a regression for each family size but for the sample as a whole. In order to include the most observations as possible we also include male respondents and, to be sure, control for sex of the respondent. \n",

This reduced form regiression tells us whehter multiple births are a valid instrument for number of children. It also shows what is the correlation between instrument and endogenous variable. If the correlation is low, it may cause large standard errors in the second stage and, thus, false insignificance of the instrumented variable (number of children in this case).   \n"

    "Generally, the estimate suggests that there is not significant impact of number of children on parental wellbeing $(p=0.234)$. However, we have also found, that this is true only for fathers because the interaction variable *female_children* is significant $(p=0.086)$ and positive. In other words, according to our results, number of children positively affect mothers'wellbeing. Namely one additional children increases mother's wellbeing almost by 0.87 point (on the 0-10 scale). \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The data form the Czech Republic suggest that there is negative but insignificant effect of fertility on wellbeing of fathers. In contrast, number of children significantly increases wellbeing of mothers. This latter finding is in conflict with the evidence from background literature. One possible explanation is that in the recent years, twins (that we use as an instrument) are born more often to mothers that undergone artificial insemination. Consequently, those mothers are more keen to have children and thus their wellbeing is positively – rather than negatively – affected. To be sure, the other (likely) possibility is that the result is incorrect due to the small sample size or modelling method. "
